The HTTP headers are used to pass additional information between the clients and the server through the request and response header. All the headers are case-insensitive, headers fields are separated by colon, key-value pairs in clear-text string format.

   // console.log(req.headers);  -> set during sending
    res.setHeader("X-myName", "Ashish yadav"); // custom header hai yeah 
    /* Always add x to custom header for maintaining industry standards */
