stateless Auth ->  backend does not have any stateholders, we put state into payload and put a stamp such that nobody can change it , although they can read it 
This is done by (Token Based Authentication)=> JSON WEB TOKEN-> JWT Token

we can set a expiry day for cookie and domain for a cookie.. they are limited to browser only 

second way is by sending in response
header :{
    authorization : Bearer tokenvalue 
}
